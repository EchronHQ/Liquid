            This article talks about data connectivity, the related concepts, its benefits, as well as a discussion on some data connectivity solutions.
            <br/><br/>

            Data-driven customer experiences are critical to success. Yet, most organisations still struggle to unify, control, and activate up-to-date data across all significant touch points.
            Data connectivity allows businesses to drive relevant, personalised interactions with audiences everywhere.

            Data connectivity regards the ability to connect platforms and securing the swift and voluminous transfer of data between them.<br/><br/>
            Developing and maintaining data connectivity is one of the most important things of all, and it is not a new subject. <br/>Today, the amount of platforms and data those platforms hold is unprecedented.

                <b>Increase usability</b> Often separate departments/platforms are accountable for storing and sharing uncontrolled, out of date versions of data. The data becomes more usable by combining data from isolated
                sources into one single
                system.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Complete data</b> By connecting your product lifecycle management systems with your other systems, every stakeholder within your organization can impact the flow of product data through your organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Better insights</b> Productivity can drastically improve when an enterprise has insights into optimising current products and processes.
                Doing this requires teams to have access to up-to-date, accurate product data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Better decisions</b> By connecting systems, everyone in your organization will have access to real-time data allowing them to make better product decisions. Decisions and actions driven by up-to-date
                information will result in
                higher product quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Increased productivity</b> By combining data, any user within your organisation can access contextual, up-to-date, real-time information. Automation of the process will reduce user errors and increase
                overall
                effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Increase in sales</b> Providing customers and partners with up-to-date, validated and complete data will increase their trust in your organisation and pursue them to purchase your products.

            <p>
                Data Connectivity solutions help <?= $this->translate('organisations') ?> connect to disparate data sources such as Saas platforms, Databases, legacy systems, etc. in real-time to gain access to data for improved
                decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can make these data sources simpler to use, more affordable, more dependable, and easier to integrate with other solutions, hence broadening the scope of how data can be used.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>High performant:</b> The performance of an operation that reads from or writes to a data store is a challenge primarily because storage is slowest among CPU, memory, or network. This performance problem
                might
                well
                become a bottleneck in your data processing pipeline. Hence you should ensure that you use the best technologies and storage mechanisms so that this challenge can be mitigated to some extent.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Intelligent:</b> Data connectivity should be intelligent and adaptive. As an example, you can have data that is flat or relational, or even hierarchical. The data might reside in relational databases,
                document
                databases, CSV files, etc. When the data is present in the CSV files there might not be any column headers. When reading from such files the data connectivity solution should be adaptiveâ€”it should be adept to
                learn the schema and also able to read the data gracefully even if the schema has changed.
            </p>
            <p>

                <b>Flexible:</b> Data connectivity should be flexible; it should be adept at establishing connections of various types and be able to work with various authentication and authorization mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Secure:</b> Data connectivity solutions should be secure; they should support authentication and authorization mechanisms so that unauthorized access to data can be prevented.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Broad and Ubiquitous:</b> Your data might reside in the cloud, on-premise, in a relational database, a NoSQL database, data warehouse, anywhere! In other words, you might have your data spread across data
                stores that
                reside on the cloud, on-premises, relational or NoSQL databases, file systems, message buses, etc. You should be able to connect to a wide range of data sources.

                In today's world, we need fast, reliable connectivity to get more done. Data matters much more than it did a couple of decades back. Whether you have your data in the cloud, on-premise, behind a firewall or
                etc.,
                you should be able to provide uninterrupted real-time connectivity to the data. Data can help you improve processes, understand customers, solve problems and make better decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Needless to mention, you should make sure that your connectivity is secure as well so that you don't get attacked. Today's developers should be able to build robust applications that are fast and can work
                with
                massive datasets using the latest technologies.
